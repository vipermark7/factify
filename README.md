# factify
A simple Django app that returns a quote from the Fact Sphere when you refresh the page

I added quotes from the Fact Sphere from a bit of parsed HTML from the Portal wiki, and I saved them as Quotes from the manage.py shell (python3 manage,py shell from the root directory, similar to how it was done in [Part 2 of the official Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial02/)
